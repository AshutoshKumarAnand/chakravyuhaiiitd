New york is a weird place. I was tired after a long flight which served only egg nog and when I arrived at the airport I took a pack of crisps that had a lemony flavour. Weird, lemon crisps. I went to a small bistro and took a peach, a chocolate and a cup of coffee. I got nostalgic on seeing the peppermint sticks hanging in a shop, they were my favourite as a kid. However I had to reach the hotel so I took a cab. The cab driver was having an orange sherbet and offered me a pineapple sherbet which tasted weird. The next thing I remember is that I woke up in a hospital. They gave me a black walnut, lemon sherbet and some coffee candies to eat. A nurse came and took away the food even before I had finished it and handed me a green mint stick. I realized its going to be a rocky road ahead.
